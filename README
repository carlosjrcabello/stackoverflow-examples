This repository will contain more or less
simple examples which I created as (parts of)
answers for questions on stackoverflow.com.

Here is my user page:

------------

The branch gc-experiment contains a start of a 
implementation of a very simplyfied version of
the Java VM, which supports only one type of
object, references to those objects, and a
31-bit primitive type.

The idea is to test garbage collection algorithms
in this simplyfied model.

It is not yet ready, but work in progress.

It was inspired by this question on Stackoverflow:
